# Documentation for Passing Grade Website

## Purpose

This website serves as a humorous and minimalist statement for anyone feeling the academic grind. Its sole purpose is to display the text "I just want a passing grade."

## Structure

The project is intentionally kept simple, consisting of:

-   `index.html`: The core of the website, containing both the HTML structure and the CSS styling for a single page.
-   `README.md`: Provides a brief overview and instructions for the project.
-   `.gitignore`: Helps keep the repository clean by excluding unnecessary files.
-   `Docs/documentation.md`: This file, detailing the project's specifics.

## Styling

The styling is embedded directly within the `<style>` tags in `index.html` to maintain a single-file solution. It uses basic CSS to center the text on the page, provide a simple background, and apply a clean font.

### Key CSS Properties:

-   **`display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;`**: Centers the content both horizontally and vertically on the page.
-   **`min-height: 100vh;`**: Ensures the body takes up at least the full height of the viewport.
-   **`background-color`**: A light grey background (`#f0f0f0`).
-   **`.container`**: A white box with a border and subtle shadow to make the text stand out.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
